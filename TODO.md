## Task: Update CV View Layout and Content

**1. Update Main Heading and Alignment**
* In the `view-cv` section of `public/index.html`, change the main top heading text from "Maria Schultz Ingerslev" to simply "CV".
* **Alignment:** Update the CSS/layout for this specific heading to ensure it is perfectly left-aligned with the "Maria Ingerslev" site title/logo in the main top navigation bar. It should share the exact same left margin/padding as the main content container.

**2. Clean up 'Detaljer' Section**
* In the "Detaljer" (Details) section at the bottom left of the CV grid, locate and completely remove the following labels and their associated values:
    * "BOPÆL" / "Danmark (>7 år)"
    * "STRAFFEATTEST" / "Ren"
* Ensure the "SPROG" entry remains intact and the layout does not break when the other items are removed.
