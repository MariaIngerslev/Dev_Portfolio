Add a right-aligned navigation menu to the header with three links: "Blogpost", "CV", and "Contact". Update public/styles.css to style "Blogpost" and "CV" as plain text links with subtle hover states. Style the "Contact" link as a prominent black pill button (background: #1a1a1a, color: white, border-radius: 50px, padding: 8px 16px).

Refactor the DOM generation for the home view in public/client.js. Create a new "Hero" section using the el() helper and place it above the blog cards. The Hero section must contain a massive H1 serif heading (e.g., "Idéer, kode og historier."), a small sans-serif sub-headline, and a pill-shaped primary button with the text "Find readings".

Update public/styles.css to style the new Hero section. Give it a very plain, clean look by setting a large minimum height (e.g., min-height: 70vh) with a completely off-white background. Center the text and the "Find readings" button. Style this button identically to the "Contact" pill button, but slightly larger.

Update public/client.js to implement a smooth scroll interaction. When the user clicks the "Find readings" button in the Hero section, the page should smoothly scroll down to the container holding the actual blog posts. Add top margin to the blog posts container to separate it clearly from the Hero section.
