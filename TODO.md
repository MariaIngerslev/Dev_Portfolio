Update public/styles.css to style the new Hero section. Give it a very plain, clean look by setting a large minimum height (e.g., min-height: 70vh) with a completely off-white background. Center the text and the "Find readings" button. Style this button identically to the "Contact" pill button, but slightly larger.
Update public/client.js to implement a smooth scroll interaction. When the user clicks the "Find readings" button in the Hero section, the page should smoothly scroll down to the container holding the actual blog posts. Add top margin to the blog posts container to separate it clearly from the Hero section.
